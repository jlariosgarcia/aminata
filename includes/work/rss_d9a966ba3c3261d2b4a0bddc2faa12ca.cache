(Which is the default query that appears when you click on this Report in the Admin panel. I found it alarming that the default query would be wrong. Why have a default query if the results are wrong? It just makes you question the validity of the report in general...) <br />
<br />
If you're wondering, because the manufacturer_id logic was in an IF statement when it shouldn't have been, when run for all manufacturers it was multiplying the quantities and dollar values for each product by the total number of manufacturers since it was not matching on each manufacturer_id as it should have been. It was running through the entire list of generated entries 39 times, in my case. Once for each manufacturer. And it was adding the same values to the running totals each time, which resulted in values 39 times what they should have been. Sure, I'd love sales numbers like that...if they were correct.) <br />
<br />
This also corrected the problem where one manufacturer name was appearing for every single product, regardless of actual manufacturer. <br />
 <br />
I also added the english file from Actionwerx while I was at it, so the column names are all formatted correctly. <br />

FULL PACKAGE for English Language only<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I was initially thinking about adding a csv download option to this but I found that, because of the way the columns are formatted, it is very easy to just highlight and copy the report results from the screen, then paste them into Excel. (Or OpenOffice, in my case...)";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 02:50:12 +0100";}i:1;a:4:{s:5:"title";s:34:"Admin Index Modules for Osc2.2rc2a";s:4:"link";s:38:"http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/9205";s:11:"description";s:572:"Dashboard modules included in OsCommerce 2.3. series, modified to work with OsCommerce 2.2rc2a like index modules.<br />
